            A rose is not just a flower,<br>
            it’s a feeling.<br><br>
            This rose is for you   
            for your smile, your warmth,  
            and the way you make days better 💖
        </p>
        <p class="rose-text">This Rose Day, I pray to God that the thorns on your life's path
             be vanished and it is filled with the beautiful petals of love, blessings and friendship.
              Happy Rose Day, sweetheart!</p>

            On this Rose Day, I bring you no garden,
            just one quiet bloom from my heart.
            It learned your name before it learned to open,
            and softened every thorn it had.
            
            A rose is not red because it must be,
            it blushes because love stands near.
            Like me when you smile my way,
            suddenly the world feels gentle and clear.
            
            So take this rose, not for its petals,
            but for the promise it quietly holds:
            to grow with care, to lean toward light,
            and love you more as time unfolds. 🌹</pre>
